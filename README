# Zippy
Zippy aims to be a cycle-accurate emulator based off of the Zilog Z80 microprocessor.

## Project Status
Basic emulation is not fully implemented! This will not run anything currently!
Currently implementing M-Cycles and T-States.

## Goals
* Cycle accuracy
* Compatibility with most Z80 software and systems. (eg. CP/M, Arcades, etc.)
* Compatibility with undocumented opcodes
* Modularity

## Todo List
* [ ] Basic emulation capability (LD, ADD, SUB, JP).
